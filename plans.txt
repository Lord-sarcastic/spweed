What I want to make:
 - A tool for producing comments and guides for developers working on an existing project.

Technology:
 - Language: Python
 - Format: YAML

Usage:
 - Terminal

Features:
 - How it works: 
    - User: Programmer writes code in project. For each file where code is written, he creates a file
      with an extension containing YAML formatted documentation, explanations and comments for each 
      function, class, block, etc

    - Tool: Parses through project directory and produces fomatted file as documentation for the 
      code. Format can be HTML, TXT, PDF, etc with bookmarks included in the file.
 - A schema diagram can be passed also to show workflow of each module of the program. A diagram 
   will be created from the diagram given

Tasks:
 - Parser:
 - Tree constructor
 - Document seeker
 - Document tree constructor
 - Document parser for YAML:
 - Document compiler
